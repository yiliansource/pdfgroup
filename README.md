A modern web application, used to split, organize and group PDF pages into different PDF documents.

Try it out at https://pdfgroup.vercel.app/!

## Installation & Setup

```console
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will run the application on your localhost. No further setup required!

## How it works

The application uses React to provide structure to the interface provided. Under the hood, _pdfjs_ is used for rendering page previews, and _pdf-lib_ is used for document manipulation. Material-UI is used for styling.
